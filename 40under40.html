                    <p>Spencer is responsible for the oversight of the city's response to dive rescue, rope rescue, collapse rescue, and confined space rescue, as well as natural and man-made disasters.</p>
                    <p>He has received 2 unit citations for admirable performance on fires where victims were rescued from within the structure and was promoted to District Chief in 2020. </p>
                    <p>From an early age, Spencer recognized God's plan for him. He was drawn to the fire service as a child and lived out his dream, beginning his career at 18 years old. Thanks to the faith-based learning received at Bishop Moore, Spencer listened to the calling and bypassed numerous academic scholarships to attend the fire College. He placed higher education on hold to fulfill God's plan. Spencer was fortunate to have mentors like Coach Saulpaugh, who encouraged Spencer to pray about the decision and ensured him that God had a plan. This mentorship was much needed at a time when most of the graduating class was preparing themselves for college. The value Bishop Moore placed on education was not forgotten. Spencer went on to complete his bachelor's degree in Public Administration. </p>
                    <p>During his high-school years, Spencer was an explorer for the Orlando Fire Department. In essence, a junior firefighter that rode on the trucks with the firemen, learning the job. After graduation, Spencer gave back to this program that prepares the community's youth for a career in the fire service. Spencer currently serves on Florida's Urban Search and Rescue Task Force 4, which deploys to natural and man-made disasters around the country. Most recently, Task Force 4 was deployed to the Surfside Building Collapse where they spent 7 days searching for survivors and recovering the remains of those lost. </p>
                    <p>Spencer lives out his faith by serving our community and raising his children in the faith. Prior to each deployment, Spencer and his wife, Amanda, pray for his safe return and trust in God's plan. They spend every day teaching their children the values they learned through their Catholic education. </p>

                    <p>Drew shared that Bishop Moore laid the spiritual and academic foundation for him to be able to set and accomplish his goals. The education that he received inspired him to become a faithful catholic husband and father who gets to help people every day through his role as a dentist at Park Smiles Dentistry in Winter Park. If it wasn’t for the supportive, faithful environment at Bishop Moore, Drew may not have been as receptive to hearing God’s calling in his life. </p>
                    <p>Drew has been blessed to go on 7 dental mission trips to Honduras and Guatemala with the Christian Dental Society from the University of Florida. He feels that dentistry is a calling and he wants to use his gifts to bless others. While it has become harder to travel to foreign countries these days, there are plenty of people within Central Florida who need help. Drew is excited to begin planning a free dental day at Park Smiles Dentistry. </p>
<p>He and his wife, Julie are active parishioners at their church. Drew was also one of the founding board members of the Orlando Chapter of Young Catholic Professionals. </p>
<p>“During the summer between my freshman and sophomore year at Bishop Moore, I was able to attend Catholic Heart Work Camp. During one prayer session at the camp, I was struck by the realization that Jesus is real and that He loves us enough that He was willing to die on the cross to save us from our sins. That truth struck me in a way that changed my life forever.” </p>
<p>“God has patiently and lovingly called me to be faithful in many ways. Each time that I say 'yes’, I am reminded of the fact that God had a plan for our lives and all we need to do is trust in Him to have fulfillment.”</p>

                    <p>Bishop Moore solidified the Catholic foundation that his parents established in him growing up. He truly believes that it was the immersive Catholic experience that prepared him to be the Christian God intended him to be. To go out into the world with full confidence of his faith and his responsibilities to represent it. BMC also gave him unforgettable athletic memories, prepared him to pursue higher learning, and left him with some of his closest friends.</p>
                    <p>Matt loves giving back to his community by donating auction items to amazing organizations such as JDRF, St. Mary Magdalen Catholic, and Gateway Orlando. It is also always a joy to participate in and donate to such events as the Anti-Golf Tournament that supports the Hope for More Foundation.</p>
                    <p>“Every day I have so many opportunities to live out my faith. The two most significant areas are in my businesses and in my own nieces’s and nephews’s faith development. In all my dealings, I allow my morals to direct how I conduct my business. Whether that is how my products are ethically sourced or by my business partners and teams seeing Christ through my actions and values. With my family, it has been one of the greatest honors of my life to be the Godfather to a number of young Christians in my family and a guide to all of them. Having them all in Catholic Schools in the Diocese of Orlando has given me an amazing gift of being able to show support at all of their ministries and events, along with being there to hold their hand through their journey of faith.”</p>

                    <p>Bishop Moore played an integral role in Larry and Miguel’s development as athletes. Both varsity athletes, Larry and Miguel fostered team building and leadership skills during their time at BMCHS, all while laying the foundation for the sense of community they would one day forge at SUBU CrossFit. They founded SUBU CrossFit in 2010 in a backyard, and made it official with their brick and mortar location in downtown Orlando in June of 2012, just miles away from BMCHS. This year, they celebrate 10 years of SUBU. Larry and Miguel have become pillars of the community. They are synonymous with SUBU CrossFit and the reason why their 170 members are as loyal as they come, now, one decade in. SUBU has grown in membership by 466% since its founding.</p>
                    <p>Each year, Miguel and Larry host a fundraiser at SUBU called Burpees for Bucks (B4B) in support of the local community. The intention of B4B is and always will be to improve the community through fitness. They feel the most overlooked demographic in our community is the underprivileged youth of Orlando. They are simply victims of circumstance. The goal of B4B is to raise as much awareness, and funds, for these young people that deserve an opportunity. Each year, B4B raises money for a local charity that supports the youth of Orlando by doing burpees. For every dollar raised, members promise to do one burpee. All of the money raised goes directly to providing aid and assistance for young people experiencing homelessness and other hardships. Over $250,000 has been raised so far through B4B.</p>
                    <p>Miguel and Larry live out their faith and values by supporting the community through fitness. As a local small business, SUBU understands the role they play in the community and the influence they have to make even the slightest difference in people’s lives.</p>

As he ages, Alberto said, and goes through more of life’s challenges, he continually re-engages in his relationship and discerns where God is leading him. The simple part, according to him, is how his faith tells him to treat others.</p>

Continued exposure to disparities in access to healthcare motivated Mary to attend law school, with a desire to advocate for patients on a larger scale. Currently, Mary is very grateful to be continuing her Catholic education at Georgetown University Law Center. Upon graduation, she hopes to work in regulatory health law and policy. </p>

                    <p>Matt transferred to BMC between his freshman and sophomore years when his family relocated from Virginia. However, he was the thirteenth Tanner to graduate from BMC, as his Dad and his ten siblings all went there. Matt and his Dad shared the same Algebra teacher, Ms. Brown. So with that legacy, it always felt like a special honor to carry that torch forward for his family. He met friends here that will be his brothers and sisters for life, and winning a state championship in soccer his senior year was something he will always cherish.</p>
                    <p>Matt has felt called to career opportunities that ultimately serve his community, working closely with first-generation college students, foster youth, veterans, immigrants, and individuals and families living in poverty. He has had the amazing privilege to work in Central America as a Peace Corps Volunteer and lead service trips to the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Costa Rica to build basketball courts as a Project Manager with Courts for Kids. A lot of the service project work he was involved in with The Mission Continues focused on environmental stewardship with deferred maintenance service projects across multiple national, state, and county parks.</p>
                    <p>Matt has little doubt that the approach that he brings to his role as a father, husband, brother, son, colleague, and community member is largely informed and influenced by his spiritual upbringing and education. Some of the simple but foundational lessons on honesty, empathy, love, forgiveness, respect, and kindness have not only helped develop Matt into the man he is today, but they serve as a constant guide for how he chooses to navigate his daily life.</p>
